# Aquiplicity

Aquiplicity helps you combine several images to create the illusion of clones. 

The idea of this program is to do layering much like Photoshop but without all 
the huge overhead of that type program.  One drag and drops their images onto
the program and the first image should be void of actors for a baseline.

Aquiplicity will look at each layer for a mathematical change in pixels
and if present assume the content of that image should be the dominant 
one brought forward for the one-image final product.  For this reason 
the original images should be taken on a tripod or other steady source
so all changes are from the target scene and not the camera movement.

If anomalies or undesired appearances exists in the image after
processing the operator has tools to pick and choose what is brought
forward for the final one-image product.

Cheers mate!
